// Package ldcommon is the base package for commonly used Go SDK types and functions.
//
// Currently there are no types in this package; they are all in subpackages such as ldvalue.
// In a future version, this package will contain the types that are most commonly needed
// when using the SDK, such as User. The subpackages contain types that applications are
// less likely to need (and that do not reference anything in the main package), such as Value.
